//serialization=> object to json conversion using .stringify() method
// deserialization => json to object conversion using JSON. parse() method .
//JSON.parse() method parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string.
//JSON.stringify() method converts a JavaScript value to a JSON string, optionally replacing values if a repl
//this conversion is done because string data can be converted into bytes to communicate over network 

// in ES6 json has the intelligence to do parse on it own using the
.json() method , which does parse job and this takes time so it 
gives promise . 
No, Promise is not a keyword in JavaScript.
It is a built-in object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. 

//in ES8 await was introduced to behave async code in sync way.
await blocks the code 
promise does not block it
